I started by typing in the command  git log --grep="segfault" and got the output:

    submodule--helper: libify even more "die" paths for module_update()
    
    As noted in a preceding commit the get_default_remote_submodule() and
    remote_submodule_branch() functions would invoke die(), and thus leave
    update_submodule() only partially lib-ified. We've addressed the
    former of those in a preceding commit, let's now address the latter.
    
    In addition to lib-ifying the function this fixes a potential (but
    obscure) segfault introduced by a logic error in
    1012a5cbc3f (submodule--helper run-update-procedure: learn --remote,
    2022-03-04):
    
    We were assuming that remote_submodule_branch() would always return
    non-NULL, but if the submodule_from_path() call in that function fails
    we'll return NULL. See its introduction in
    92bbe7ccf1f (submodule--helper: add remote-branch helper,
    2016-08-03). I.e. we'd previously have segfaulted in the xstrfmt()
    call in update_submodule() seen in the context.

    ssh signing: verify ssh-keygen in test prereq
    
    Do a full ssh signing, find-principals and verify operation in the test
    prereq's to make sure ssh-keygen works as expected. Only generating the
    keys and verifying its presence is not sufficient in some situations.
    One example was ssh-keygen creating unusable ssh keys in cygwin because
    of unsafe default permissions for the key files. The other a broken
    openssh 8.7 that segfaulted on any find-principals operation. This
    extended prereq check avoids future test breakages in case ssh-keygen or
    any environment behaviour changes.

The common denominator seems to be diff-lib. In the list of files, I found difflib.c. Looking within this file, I found the author "Đoàn Trần Công Danh". To look further into this, I used the command git blame diff-lib.c | grep "Đoàn Trần Công Danh" and got the output:


8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 120) if (revs->diffopt.prefix &&
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 121)     strncmp(ce->name, revs->diffopt.prefix, revs->diffopt.prefix_length))
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 122) continue;
8174627b3d3 diff-lib.c (Đoàn Trần Công Danh     2021-08-22 15:49:08 +0700 123) 




Which is the code that fixes the problem.
