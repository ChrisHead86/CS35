First, to find when the commit with the line was made and the author/people who contributed to it, I used the command:
git log -S “Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.” 


Giving the following output:
commit c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b

This gives us the ID of the commit, so we can look further into who made this change.
We use the following command:
git show c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b > outputA4.out






We emacs into the file outputA4.out, use the incremental search C-s to find the line in question and get the following context:
From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
+# Indiana generally observes either EST all year, or CST/CDT,
+# but areas near Cincinnati and Louisville use those cities' timekeeping
+# and in 1969 and 1970 the whole state observed daylight time;
+# and there are other exceptions as noted below.
+# Shanks partitions Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
+# and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''
+# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
+#
+# Since 1970, EST-only Indiana has been like America/Indianapolis,
+# with exceptions noted below for Crawford, Starke, and Switzerland counties.
+# The parts of Indiana not listed below have been like America/Chicago,
+# America/Louisville, or America/New_York.
+#
+# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
+# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the `America' level.
+# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory `America/Indiana'.
+#
+# Most of EST-only Indiana last observed DST in 1970.
